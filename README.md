# Crypto-Efficient-Asset-Management
This repo contains the final project for the class Finance with Big Data, as part of the MSc in Data Science @ Bocconi University. The project consist of a smart contract which serves as a pool of funds that are allocated between different ERC-20 tokens using off-chain Markowitz portfolio optimization. In order to implement the optimization, the smart contract will communicate with a DEX and buy/sell ETH-based fixed rate lending/borrowing as risk-free assets.
